# üîê Portable Secret
A low-tech, super-portable trick to:
 * Carry important secrets
 * Talk and exchange files privately with people less tech-savvy than you
 * Store your most important secret in plain sight, online or offline, and access them without special software or key

---

Portable Secret (`PS`) it's not a product and is barely a project.
**It is merely a neat trick, a *hack***.
The [source code](https://github.com/mprimi/portable-secret) and tool provided are merely a demonstration.

## The problem

If I communicate with most people online, I need to lower my desired level of privacy to whatever they're willing to put up with.

**I can't expect my mom to learn how to send [PGP mail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy). I can't expect my accountant to learn to use [age](https://github.com/FiloSottile/age). Etc.**

How can I dial up the privacy a couple of notches, when needed, without inconveniencing the other party, or requiring special software and skills?

`PS` is my answer to this question. Using only household software that everyone already knows how to use.

### Bonus

Turns out this little trick is also great to transmit secrets to myself in a future emergency.
e.g. **stranded in a foreign country, all my documents and device stolen**.

`PS` provides a way to get back into all my systems with any computer from anywhere in the world.

## How it works

A `Portable Secret` is a self-contained HTML file containing an encrypted payload.
It also contains a few lines of pure Javascript (with no external calls or dependencies) to leverage the browser built-in [Web Cryptography APIs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Crypto_API) to decrypt the secret.

These HTML files can be sent (over E-mail, SMS, ...) or stored online (Dropbox, FTP, Cloud Drive, ...).

The receiver can open the file in any web browser on any platform, even without an internet connection.

The decrypted data exists temporarily within the browser window context.

Try this **[example](https://mprimi.github.io/portable-secret/example.html)**.

### On Portability

I call this kind of secret *portable* because:

 * It consists of a single HTML file with no external dependencies
 * It can be easily carried and stored (on devices, cloud drives, USB drives, FTP and web servers, ...)
 * It requires no internet connection to decrypt (or encrypt for that matter)
 * It can be opened securely on any device and operating system that can run a semi-modern web browser
 * It uses NIST-recommended standard algorithms (e.g. compatible encryption/decryption can be trivially implemented in any language)

## Usage for personal communications

Here are some daily digital life scenarios, and how I use Portable Secret to stay a little more safe and private when talking to friends and family online.

#### Share a password, bank account number, padlock code, spare house key hiding place, ...

Examples:
 * send my bank account number to a new employer
 * share the WiFi password with a friend visiting
 * share my Netflix password with my partner

Text or email are the most convenient ways to share. But they are not private (service providers can read them), and not forward-secure.

In these scenarios, I create a one-time Portable Secret and send it over text or email. The secret password can be easily shared "over the air" (as in: yelled from the next room over, or relayed over a phone call), e.g.: [correct-horse-battery-staple](https://xkcd.com/936/)

#### Share pictures and files

Examples:
 * send my partner a spicy picture
 * share a confidential document draft with a client
 * send a particularly sensitive letter to a friend
 * share financial information with my accountant

It is hard to share a picture with someone without also sharing it with your service provider (Facebook, Google, Apple, At&T, ...). Future data breaches at these providers may leak your very embarrassing picture with the internet, forever.

Similarly to the password-sharing case, I create a one-time Portable Secret and send it over text or email. Then communicate the password via a separate channel, or better, create a password out of secrets that already exist between me and the receiver.

## Usage for disaster recovery

Portable Secret was motivated by communication privacy, but it is also great to communicate with myself in the future, during a crisis!

The following scenarios are often on my mind, and I've never encountered a solution that I like more than Portable Secret.

#### All your device are belong to us[*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_your_base_are_belong_to_us)

Example:
 * a burglar breaks into my house and steals *all* my phones, computers, and external drives
 * a ransomware attack locks me out of all my systems

At this point, I'd be *royally* screwed. No access to my (encrypted) offsite backups; no access to email and phone, which make it impossible to reset passwords, and access password managers.

Using Portable Secret I can get out of this pickle.
Within minutes, using any computer, I can access a subset of my top-level recovery keys (GPG key, backup keys, 2FA seeds, SSH keys, ...), without needing any special software and without having to remember any difficult passwords.

I store critical top-level keys as Portable Secrets on USB drives stashed in strategic places. I also have copies published on the internet!

If any of these copies fall into the hands of an adversary, I am not worried they'll be able to extract or use them.

#### Stranded abroad

Example:
 * While traveling abroad, my passport, phone, and money get stolen

Another nightmare scenario. Using Portable Secrets, I store a copy of my passport and credit card number in a hidden corner of a website I own (unlinked to me).

If the nightmare scenario ever becomes reality, I can get my hands on a copy of my password and some funds within a minute, from any computer without any special software.

Anyone else stumbling on these secrets by lucky accident, would not be able to decrypt them.

#### Untimely demise

Example:
 * I get hit by a bus

Dealing with a death in the family is unpleasant enough. I don't want to subject my family to months of extra work to figure out my assets and accounts.

For this situation, I have created a Portable Secret for my family members. It can be opened by combining answers to secret questions only a few people would know.

The secret contains a message for my family members, and documents proving my ownership of my most important assets.

## Miscellaneous

### Prior art

I came up with Portable Secret on my own, but it's such a simple idea that I'm sure others must have had the same, somewhere out there. I didn't find any before setting up this repository, but I also didn't search very hard.

If you are aware of any similar projects, please let me know and I'll link them here.

### On tools

Portable Secret is a *tool*. As such, it can be used *wrong* (e.g. weak password), or used to do bad things (e.g., exfiltrate intellectual property).

I cannot take responsibility for such misuse any more than a hammer manufacturer can take responsibility for me hammering my thumb, or using the hammer to attack someone.

I can only hope that the benefits outweigh the costs, i.e. for every 1 bad usage, there are 1000 good ones.
We apply the same risk-benefit calculation to everything else in our lives that can be used for good and bad (hammers, cars, cameras, computers, ...).
