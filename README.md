# üîê Portable Secret
A low-tech, super-portable hack to securely carry your most important secrets with you.

Can also be used to communicate privately over non-secure channels (email, SMS, cloud drives, etc.)

---

Portable Secret (`PS`) it's not a product and barely a project. It is a trick, a *hack*.
The [source code](https://github.com/mprimi/portable-secret) and tool provided are merely a demonstration of such a hack.

## Motivation

Securely storing and exchanging secrets can be tricky, even for experts. **I wanted a tool so simple that even my mom could learn how to use it**. I have been using `PS` with family and friends to communicate privately, when the circumstances require it.

It can also be used to create secure key backups accessible from anywhere without special software.

## How it works

A `Portable Secret` is self-contained HTML file containing an encrypted payload.
A few lines of pure Javascript (no external dependencies) use the browser built-in [Web Cryptography APIs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Crypto_API) to decrypt the secret.

These files can be sent over email, SMS, or stored online (Dropbox, FTP, Cloud Drive, ...).

The receiver can open the file in a web browser, even without an internet connection.
If they know the password, they can and retrieve the secret.
No data leaves the browser window context.

Try this **[example](https://mprimi.github.io/portable-secret/example.html)**.

## Usage scenario

I use `PS` in in the following situations:

#### Store top-level keys

I use `PS` to store my top-level secret keys (e.g. PGP key, backup recovery key, primary email address password, password manager recovery key, 2FA seeds, ...).

**Paranoid scenario**: a burglar breaks into my home and steals **ALL** my devices. Using `PS`  I'd still be able to get back into most of my systems, as long as I have access to at least one of the copies of my secrets I have stashed in various secret places (both online and offline) if the burglar obtained some of these copies, they won't be able to use them.


#### Store critical documents

I use `PS` to store a picture of my passport on a (non-indexed) page of a website I own.

*Paranoid scenario*: I am stuck in a foreign country, all my documents lost and my devices unable to connect.
As long as I can use a computer with a browser, I can visit that page and download a copy of the passport. Nobody else that stumbles upon that page will be able to extract its content

#### Share passwords with family

I use `PS` to encrypt passwords and other confidential bits of information (Netflix password, bank account number, tax returns, PINs, ...) and send them over non-secure channels (SMS, email, Dropbox, AirDrop, ...).
The `PS` key required to unlock such a secret can be transmitted securely *over the air* (as in: yell it from the next room over :-P).

*Paranoid scenario*: an attacker has gained access to a family member's device and can intercept all communications. This is a grave situation, but thanks to `PS` some critical bits of information would be protected from the attacker prying eyes.

#### Share documents with collaborators

I use `PS` to share drafts of projects with selected collaborators. It also works to send tax documents to my accountant. I send the file via email, then the key over a voice call.
The receiver can open the file without needing any special software (except for a browser).
This is similar to sharing an encrypted PDF, except I trust my solution more. Plus it works with any file type.

*Paranoid scenario*: The receiver's email account (or server) has been compromised, and the attacker has access to all messages ever received. Thanks to `PS`, my documents will be safe
(clearly, this does not protect me from an attacker gaining access to the storage system where these files end up being saved unencrypted. Nothing short of divine intervention can  protect me from such an attack).


#### Talk privately to friends, and share pictures

I sometimes want to send or receive a text or a picture that and NOT share it with the platform I'm sending it with, e.g., a spicy picture from my partner, a rant about coworker, or a joke that could hurt my reputation if read by someone that doesn't know me.
I do not trust the Big Tech companies with this kind of content, and neither should you.

*Paranoid scenario*: Google is reading my emails, Facebook is reading my messages, no dispute here. At any time in the future, my conversation on these platforms may leak (disgruntled employee, nation-state hack, sheer incompetence, ...). I'm ok with 99.999% of my messages leaking online. For the remaining 0.001%, I use `PS`, and I sleep better at night.

#### Unexpected game over

I worry about the troubles my family could run into in case of my unexpected death.
I use `PS` to encrypt letters to my family to be opened in such a situation. They contain instructions for accessing my secure data and accounts.

*Paranoid scenario*: I get hit by a bus. Because I store my data securely, my family would have no access to any online account, bank and other asset details. They may have to jump through many, many oops to recover access, if they even manage to discover they exist.


## On Portability

I call this kind of secret *portable* because:

 * It consists of a single HTML file with no external dependencies
 * It can be easily carried and stored (on devices, cloud drives, USB drives, FTP and web servers, ...)
 * It requires no internet connection to decrypt (or encrypt for that matter)
 * It can be opened securely on any device and operating system that can run a semi-modern web browser
 * It uses NIST-recommended standard algorithm (e.g. compatible encryption/decryption can be trivially implemented in any language)

### On tools

Portable Secret is a *tool*. As such, it can be used *wrong* (e.g. weak password), or used to do bad things (e.g., facilitate exfiltration of intellectual property, or exchange copyrighted material).

I cannot take responsibility for such misuse any more than a hammer manufacturer can take responsibility for you hammering your thumb, or using the hammer to attack someone.

I can only hope that for each bad usage, there are 1000 good ones (whatever good and bad means to me).

Hammers, cars, computers, and anything else can be used for good and for bad.
